# Leagues

The Leagues game mode (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Leagues) on this server: a league
character per account, League Points, relic tiers and relics. Plugins: `plugins/modes/LeagueMode.plugin.js`
(the profile, its league, XP rate, journal tab), `LeaguePoints.plugin.js` (points) and
`LeagueRelics.plugin.js` (tiers and relics); data in `plugins/modes/data/leagues.json` and
`league-relics.json`.

## The league character

Live OSRS runs Leagues on their own worlds, where an account plays a fresh character. Here a
world runs a league when its plugin config says so:

```json
"pluginConfig": { "league:type": 4 }
```

(4 Trailblazer Reloaded, 5 Raging Echoes; `world.local.json` can set it per deployment).
LeagueMode reads it at startup and claims the world's character profile (`api.setWorldProfile`,
`GameConstants.WORLD_PROFILE`), so every login is the account's **league character**, a save
kept apart from its main one (`persistence/PlayerProfile.ts`):

- JSON saves: `data/saves/characters/league/<name>.json` beside the main `<name>.json`.
- SQLite and IndexedDB: the key `league:<name>`, prefixed after the name is normalised, so no
  account name can collide with it.
- `Player.getProfile()` says which character is online; it is never written into the save. Both
  share the name, so only one can be online at a time, as on live, and friends see the account
  online either way.
- The account has one credential: its main character's. A league character's own hash only
  stands in while no main character exists (an account first made on a league world), and a
  main character made later takes it. So a name can't be claimed on either world with a password
  of one's own, and `::changepassword` (`PlayerPersistence.changePassword`) writes the new hash
  to both characters and signs out every remembered login on both.
- A "Stay logged in" token belongs to the character it was issued on (each save keeps its own),
  and the world decides the character, so a token from one world's character never opens the
  other's.
- Every league character plays as a standard Ironman (Wiki "Player restrictions": all players
  are Ironmen). Every league login sets a character that is anything else (new, made before this
  rule, or changed with `::ironman`) through the Ironman plugin's `ironman:set-mode`; the Ironman
  plugin's trading, loot, shop and Grand Exchange rules then apply as to any Ironman. The mode
  stays: the Ironman tutor's and Adam's setup ask `ironman:change-mode` before a change, and
  LeagueMode refuses it for a league character ("As a league character, you are always an
  Ironman.", ours). `::ironman` overrides it only until the next login. A main character's mode is
  its own. The rule needs the Ironman plugin enabled; with it disabled in world.json a league
  character is not an Ironman and nothing says so.
- Admin and save commands that look a save up by name address the character this world logs in:
  the league character on a league world (`GameConstants.WORLD_PROFILE`), the main one elsewhere, so a plain world is unchanged. That is
  `::snapshots`, `::rollback` and `::reprocorruptsave`, and the save-exists check of `::mute`,
  `::unmute`, `::ban` and `::unban` (those four are still stubs that punish nobody).
- Known limits: the SQLite backend's one-time import of legacy JSON saves reads only the main
  files; an offline update to either save (an external store purchase) is refused while the
  account's other character is online, since both share the name; the friends chat's offline
  owner lookup (`FriendsChatManager.js`) and the AI bots' name checks (`RegisterAiBots`,
  `PlayerFactory`) still read the main save only, so on a league world an offline owner's channel
  is the main character's and a name held only by a league character counts as free for a bot.

The world's league is the one a new league character joins; the character keeps it in
`league:type`. A new Trailblazer Reloaded character starts at Herblore 3, Runecraft 5 and
Agility 10 (Wiki). A main character never has a league, whatever its attributes say.

## What the client is sent

From the rsprox Leagues V recordings (osrs-captures 227/00070 and 227/00075; the packets are the
same for every league):

- Login: varbits `league_account` 10031 = 1, `league_type` 10032, `league_tutorial_completed`
  10037 = 12, `league_total_tasks_completed` 10046; varps `league_points_completed` 2614,
  `league_points_claimed` 2615, `league_points_previous` 2807; the relic selection varbits.
- A task award: 10046 and 2614 rise, then 2615; the popup (`notification:show`) "League Task
  Complete!" / "Task Completed: <col=ffffff>Name</col><br><br>Points Earned: <col=ffffff>N</col>"
  in the league's colour with jingle 283, and script 3226 refills the side panel's bar (656:23).
- The journal's Leagues tab (side_journal 629:34) shows once the varbits are set; a click mounts
  the league side panel (656) in the journal's content container (629:43) with the tab varbit
  8168 = 4, the way this client mounts its other journal tabs (live mounted it in its own slot).
- XP: the league's rate (5x; 8x from relic tier 2, 12x from tier 5, 16x from tier 7, Wiki tier
  passives) multiplies every gain after the world's rate, through the can-gain-experience
  hook's `multiplier`.

## Relics

`LeagueRelics.plugin.js`, data `plugins/modes/data/league-relics.json`: eight tiers a league,
each with a point cost, a passive and three relics (Wiki); a tier's pick is permanent. A
character's picks live in `league:relics` (tier index -> slot 1-3).

- **The catalog.** The cache's relic interface (655) reads the league struct's tier enum (param
  870), tier structs (877 cost, 878 relic enum, 2045 passive struct) and relic structs (879 name,
  880 description, 885 tier, 1855 has-item), but the cache only carries the current league's.
  The server sends a league's own as `structOverrides` / `enumOverrides` datasets
  (`sendContentData`; `GamemodeContentStore` and the cs2 `struct_param` / `enum` ops read them
  before the cache) at login and before the interface opens. Ids start at 200000 + league type
  x 1000; icons are borrowed from the cache's own relic in the same tier and slot.
- **The flow, as captured.** The side panel's View Relics (656:44) opens 655 as the main modal
  with `if_setevents` on its slots (655:22, 0-23) and menu (655:6, 10-20). A slot click sets
  `league_relic_last_viewed` (10048) to tier x 3 + slot and runs the client's redraw scripts 3193
  (the panel's components, the state 2 both captured clicks sent for an affordable, unchosen
  tier (other states were not captured), the relic struct, the tier's passive struct) and 3181. Confirm (655:50) unlocks the viewed relic: its tier's selection varbit
  (10049-10053, 11696, 17301, 17302) = the slot, animation 8524, the league's unlock graphic
  (struct param 1021: 2603 Trailblazer Reloaded, 3044 Raging Echoes) at height 92, the modal
  closed, sounds 4215/4211/4213/4212 at 8/44/80/104. Points crossing a tier's cost show "New
  Relic Available!" / "You've gained enough points to unlock a tier N Relic!" with jingle 281, in
  the orange the capture shows on a Raging Echoes world (the task popup, by contrast, uses the
  league's colour). Slot and confirm clicks count only after View Relics opened the interface.
- **The checks.** A league character, a real slot, no pick in that tier, the tier's points, a
  bank open when the relic hands out an item (the Wiki's reason for unlocking those in one; the
  modal replaces the bank as the main interface, so what was open when View Relics was clicked
  counts), and room for every item in the inventory or a bank tab, so a permanent pick is never
  saved without its items; each item goes to the inventory if it fits, else to its bank tab, else
  to any tab with room. Refusals are game messages of ours. Items no longer in this cache (Sage's greaves, the Trailblazer tools, the crystal of
  memories, the guardian horn) are not granted; the data says so.
- **Effects** are other plugins' business: they ask `league:has-relic { player, relic }`, true
  only when the character's league has that relic and chose it. The tier passives' XP rates are
  LeagueMode's (`league:highest-tier`); the other passives are not implemented.

### Trailblazer Reloaded's combat relics

Three relics have their effects (`leaguerelics/*.LeagueRelics.js`, numbers in the data's
`effects`; the Wiki's, as no recording of Trailblazer Reloaded exists):

- **Superior Sorcerer** (tier 4): magic attacks every 2 ticks (the new `onAttackSpeed` hook, asked
  after the weapon's, spell's or special's own speed), magic accuracy x2.75 and +200 permille
  magic damage (the equipment-effect modifiers), a 90% roll a cast that keeps the runes (the
  existing `magic:rune-saving`, asked once the cast has checked the player has them, so they are
  required but not spent) or the staff's charge (`combat:consume-charge`, asked by the trident in
  core and by the Sanguinesti staff and Tumeken's shadow before a charge is spent), in multicombat
  a landed spell also hits up to five attackable targets within a tile of its target for 0 to 25%
  of its damage (fixed-damage hits that pay no XP, never splash themselves and are not scaled
  again by Berserker, since the hit they derive from already was), and the standard
  binds and Ancient ice spells always land unless the target is frozen or still freeze-immune.
- **Berserker** (tier 7): every hit is multiplied by 1 + 0.004 x missing hitpoints (floored), and a
  hit on an NPC at full health is forced accurate at its max.
- **Undying Retribution** (tier 8): when a death would go ahead (`onPlayerBeforeDeath`, after any
  other content kept the player alive) and three minutes have passed since it last fired:
  hitpoints and prayer to their max, poison, venom and the poison immunity cleared, the
  Retribution prayer's graphic 437 (ours), and a reflected hit of 0 to 2 x Prayer level on every
  attackable NPC within three tiles that is not attack-immune and that the area's policy lets
  the player fight (recoil-immune ones only if Nex, the Hespori, Vorkath or a Wilderness boss)
  and 0 to half the Prayer level on each player fighting them. The cooldown is
  a timestamp attribute (0 when ready), reset by a real death (the defeated hook, which every
  death reaches; the death hook stops at the first plugin that handles the death, as the raids
  do, so a death inside one would never have reset it). A plugin that already prevented the
  death on this hook is honoured; one attached after this plugin would see the relic fire first,
  since every before-death hook runs. A prevented death counts for nothing in a raid (Wiki: no
  raid death penalties): core never starts the death task, so the Chambers, Theatre, Tombs and
  Archive death handlers, which take points, count deaths, jail, ghost and check wipes, never run.
- **The Arcane grimoire** (`ArcaneGrimoire.LeagueRelics.js`), the item Superior Sorcerer and Raging
  Echoes' Grimoire relic grant: for a league character its cache options, from the inventory or
  worn, are Change Spellbook (a chat choice of the other three books), Previous Spellbook (back
  to the book the last change left; it toggles) and Check Previous (ours: "Your previous
  spellbook was the Ancient spellbook."). The swap is the altars' (`MagicSpellbook.changeSpellbook`:
  Lunar's 40 Defence, autocast cleared, the tab, "You have changed your magic spellbook."); this
  server's altars gate the books on nothing else, so neither does the grimoire where the
  Trailblazer Reloaded relics page says "providing players have unlocked them". The previous book
  is the attribute `league:grimoire-previous-spellbook`, remembered only when a swap went through.
  Holding the item is the only check (it is untradeable and only a relic grants it; a spawned one
  works for any league character). Not covered: its Book of the Dead role (the resurrection
  spells' requirement, checked in core), and Raging Echoes' Grimoire unlocking every prayer and
  spell.

## The league tutorial

Not implemented; what it takes, from the Leagues V recordings (osrs-captures 227/00196 and
227/01718 are full runs, 227/00546 a logout at stage 0) and this cache. A league character is
sent `league_tutorial_completed` 10037 = 12 (finished) at login until it exists.

- **A stage machine on varbit 10037** (0 to 12; Leagues VI has two more). The server only sets
  the varbit and (re)opens the interfaces: `league_tutorial` 653 as an overlay in 164:1 with its
  click-blocker 653:1 unhidden, `mesoverlay` 263 in the chatbox (162:564), scripts 1974 "" and
  2524 (-1, -1), then the modal `league_tutorial_main` 677 in 164:16; every stage change repeats
  that block. The client draws each stage's title, body, buttons and graphic itself from the
  league struct's param 1033 tutorial struct (enums keyed by 10037: Raging Echoes' struct 6211
  points at struct 747 and enums 3379-3383). Check that Trailblazer Reloaded's struct 4699 still
  carries them; if not, send them as `structOverrides` / `enumOverrides` like the relic catalog.
- **First login** (00196): `orbs_disabled` 4084 = 1, `minimap_toggle` 0, a teleport to Lumbridge
  (3221, 3216, 0), and the starting kit as the inventory (a dramen staff, bronze axe, pickaxe,
  tinderbox, net, shrimp, bronze dagger and sword, wooden shield, shortbow, 25 bronze arrows, 25
  air, 15 mind, 6 water, 4 earth and 2 body runes, a bucket, a pot, bread); the tutorial opens
  after the welcome screen's Play (378:72). The dramen staff is simply in the kit; The Sage
  (14143/14144 at 3222, 3213) talks only about combat achievement rewards and echo items in these
  recordings (the Wiki's "claim a free dramen staff from The Sage" is Trailblazer Reloaded's).
- **The stages:** 0->3 "Get Started" (677:9; sets `league_3_has_seen_cutscene` 13488 = 1); 3->4
  the quest tab (164:54, script 3162 flashes the journal's Leagues tab); 4->5 the journal's
  Leagues tab, which also awards "Open the Leagues Menu" (+10) and mounts the side panel (script
  3185 highlights 656:35); 5->6 the panel's Tasks button (656:36) opens `league_tasks` 657 and a
  `screenhighlight` 664 walkthrough (scripts 3408/3409/3413/2463/2465, continue 664:31); 6->7 its
  last continue; 7->8 Areas (656:40) opens `trailblazer_areas` 512 with a walkthrough; 8->9 an
  area unlocked; 9->10 Relics (656:44) opens 655 with a walkthrough; 10->11 the first relic's
  item box; 11->12 "End Tutorial" (677:8), which awards "Complete the Leagues Tutorial" (+10), sets
  `orbs_disabled` back to 0 and closes 677 then 653. "Exit Leagues" (677:8 at stage 0) was never
  pressed in a recording.
- **What it waits on:** the task list (657) and the area interface (512) with their walkthroughs,
  and the tasks it awards; a tutorial that starts but cannot be finished is worse than none. A
  new league character also skips Tutorial Island on live; this server sends every new account
  there.

## Developer commands

- `::league [player]` - the character's league and points.
- `::leaguetask <id> <points> [name]` - award yourself a task through the real award path (the
  task catalog, LeagueTasks, does not exist yet).
- `::relic [tier 1-8] [slot 1-3]` - list your relics, or choose one through the usual checks.

## Not yet

League tasks, area unlocks, combat masteries, the other tier passives (drop rates, run energy,
clue boxes, minigame points), the league tutorial (see above), trophies and rewards. Each is its
own item on the progress tracker.
