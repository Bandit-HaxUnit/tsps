# Leagues

The Leagues game mode (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Leagues) on this server: a league
character per account, League Points, ranks, relic tiers and relics, and the league screens.
Plugins: `plugins/modes/LeagueMode.plugin.js` (the profile, its league, XP rate, journal tab, the
side panel's Summary / Info / Rank screens, ranks, statistics, the content its screens need),
`LeaguePoints.plugin.js` (points) and `LeagueRelics.plugin.js` (tiers and relics); data in
`plugins/modes/data/leagues.json`, `league-ranks.json` and `league-relics.json`.

## The league character

Live OSRS runs Leagues on their own worlds, where an account plays a fresh character. Here a
world runs a league when its plugin config says so:

```json
"pluginConfig": { "league:type": 4 }
```

(every league the cache names in enum 2670: 1 Twisted, 2 Trailblazer, 3 Shattered Relics, 4
Trailblazer Reloaded, 5 Raging Echoes, 6 Demonic Pacts; `world.local.json` can set it per
deployment, and `pluginConfig` `"league:start"`, an ISO date, says when the league began for the
client's league clock). LeagueMode reads it at startup and claims the world's character profile
(`api.setWorldProfile`, `GameConstants.WORLD_PROFILE`), so every login is the account's **league
character**, a save kept apart from its main one (`persistence/PlayerProfile.ts`):

- JSON saves: `data/saves/characters/league/<name>.json` beside the main `<name>.json`.
- SQLite and IndexedDB: the key `league:<name>`, prefixed after the name is normalised, so no
  account name can collide with it.
- `Player.getProfile()` says which character is online; it is never written into the save. Both
  share the name, so only one can be online at a time, as on live, and friends see the account
  online either way.
- The account has one credential: its main character's. A league character's own hash only
  stands in while no main character exists (an account first made on a league world), and a
  main character made later takes it. So a name can't be claimed on either world with a password
  of one's own, and `::changepassword` (`PlayerPersistence.changePassword`) writes the new hash
  to both characters and signs out every remembered login on both.
- A "Stay logged in" token belongs to the character it was issued on (each save keeps its own),
  and the world decides the character, so a token from one world's character never opens the
  other's.
- Known limits: the SQLite backend's one-time import of legacy JSON saves reads only the main
  files; admin commands that address saves by name reach the main profile only; an offline
  update to either save (an external store purchase) is refused while the account's other
  character is online, since both share the name.

The world's league is the one a new league character joins; the character keeps it in
`league:type`. A new character starts at the league's levels (Wiki: Trailblazer and Trailblazer
Reloaded Herblore 3, Runecraft 5, Agility 10; Raging Echoes and Demonic Pacts Herblore 3 and
Runecraft 5; Twisted Herblore 3; Shattered Relics none, its skills being unlocked with Renown). A
main character never has a league, whatever its attributes say. Leagues I-III have their names,
colours and screens here but no relic, area or task catalogs yet.

## What the client is sent

From the rsprox Leagues V recordings (osrs-captures 227/00070 and 227/00075; the packets are the
same for every league):

- Login: varbits `league_account` 10031 = 1, `league_type` 10032, `league_tutorial_completed`
  10037 = 12, `league_total_tasks_completed` 10046, `league_rank_notification` 17299 (the ranks
  reached), `current_runeday` 9535 (whole days since 27 February 2002: live sends it with the
  journal tabs and the Info panel's script reads it); varps `league_points_completed` 2614,
  `league_points_claimed` 2615, `league_points_previous` 2807, the summary's tracking varps
  (below) and, when the world's `league:start` is set, `tracking_playtime_leagues` 4523 =
  minutes since the epoch of the league's start (the same value for every player in the Leagues V
  captures, 27 November 2024, so it is the league's clock, not a play time); the relic selection
  varbits.
- A task award: 10046 and 2614 rise, then 2615; the popup (`notification:show`) "League Task
  Complete!" / "Task Completed: <col=ffffff>Name</col><br><br>Points Earned: <col=ffffff>N</col>"
  in the league's colour with jingle 283, and script 3226 refills the side panel's bar (656:23).
- The journal's Leagues tab (side_journal 629:34) shows once the varbits are set; a click mounts
  the league side panel (656) in the journal's content container (629:43) with the tab varbit
  8168 = 4, the way this client mounts its other journal tabs (live mounted it in its own slot).
- XP: the league's rate (5x; 8x from relic tier 2, 12x from tier 5, 16x from tier 7, Wiki tier
  passives) multiplies every gain after the world's rate, through the can-gain-experience
  hook's `multiplier`.

## The content payload

A league's screens read structs and enums the rev 241 cache only holds for the current league
(Demonic Pacts): the relic catalog, Leagues I-III's rank thresholds. `league/Content.LeagueMode.js`
asks every unit for its rows (`league:content-rows`) and sends them as one `structOverrides` /
`enumOverrides` payload (`sendContentData`; the client's `GamemodeContentStore` replaces the whole
set on each payload, which is why no unit sends its own; rows for one struct from several units
are merged into one) at a league login and on `league:send-content`. Virtual ids start at 200000 + league type x 1000; the relics use offsets
0-199, the ranks 900-901. A league the cache carries sends an empty payload (Demonic Pacts: no
overrides at all), which also clears whatever another league left in the client.

## Panels

The side panel's three top buttons, each opening its interface as the main modal with the click
events on its menu frame, as captured (227/00075, 227/01845, 227/00579); the client draws the rest
from varps and the league struct, so the server sends nothing else (`league/Panels.LeagueMode.js`,
data `panels`):

- Before each, script 2524 sizes the modal, as live ran it: (-1, -1) for the Summary and Rank,
  (-1, -3) for the Info panel and the relic interface.
- **Summary** (656:7 -> `league_summary` 529): sound 2266, `if_setevents` on the stats row 2 (Time
  Played, OP1 and the six target kinds) and script 7741 `[529:23, 2, "(Click to reveal)"]`; a click
  on that row closes and re-opens the summary with the time played, in the captured shape (the two
  largest non-zero units: "17 days, 2 hours", "17 days, 58 minutes", "19 hours, 46 minutes"), and
  it stays revealed for the session. The time is the character's time online, counted here
  (`league:play-time`, milliseconds, saved every minute and at logout) since the capture has no
  play-time varp. Each of the three asks for the content payload again before it opens.
  Live also ran the account summary's playtime script (3970) on the open; not sent, since that
  panel is not mounted here. The rows read the points and task varps (LeaguePoints), the relic and
  area selection varbits, varp 5484 `talent_points_earned` (Demonic Pacts' masteries, theirs) and
  the statistics below. Every league type.
- **Info** (656:2 -> `league_info` 654): `if_setevents` OP1 on `league_menu_frame` 654:17 slots
  12-18. The panel's texts are the league struct's (the cache's, every league type).
- **Rank** (656:10 -> `league_rank` 64): `if_setevents` OP1 on 64:16 slots 10-18; script 730 draws
  the seven ranks from the struct's threshold enum (param 1857) and trophy enum (2041), the names
  from enum 5201 and `league_points_completed`.

### Ranks

`league/Rank.LeagueMode.js`, data `league-ranks.json`: seven ranks a league (Bronze to Dragon) at
the League Points thresholds the trophies are awarded in. Leagues IV-VI's are the cache's enums
(5237 / 5719 / 5979; the Wiki's League_trophy tables agree, and the test checks it); Leagues
I-III's structs carry none, so their rows are the Wiki's thresholds and the cache's trophy items
by name, sent through the content payload. As captured, varbit `league_rank_notification` 17299 =
the number of ranks reached, sent at login and on the award that crosses a threshold, with one
game message per rank (`<col=229628>You've obtained Iron rank! You can claim your trophy from the
Leagues Tutor in the main game.`); no popup. Trophies themselves (447) are not handed out yet.

### Statistics

`league/Statistics.LeagueMode.js`, data `statistics`: the summary's rows read the `tracking_*`
varps 4510-4527 and varbit 11561; the server counts what its hooks see for a league character,
one attribute `league:statistics` (name -> value), sent at login and as each changes: NPCs killed
(`onNpcDeath`; bosses by the cache's boss param 1361, as NpcDrops reads it), deaths, players
killed (`onPlayerDefeated`), damage dealt to NPCs and the highest hit (each hitsplat's `onApplied` as it lands, attached in
`onCombatHitResolved`, so a cancelled projectile counts nothing),
damage taken from NPCs (`onCombatHitResolved`), food (`food:eaten`), potions (`potions:drunk`),
fish, ore and logs (`fishing:success`, `mining:success`, `woodcutting:success`). Stubbed at 0 for
want of a source: echo bosses killed (none here), coins gained and lost, clues completed (no
completion event), special attacks used (the special flag is cleared before the hit resolves) and
the highest value item worn.

## Tutorial

`league/Tutorial.LeagueMode.js`, data `league-tutorial.json` (generated from the two recorded runs
on new characters: osrs-captures 227/00196 Raging Echoes and 237/01098 Demonic Pacts). A new
league character starts at `league_tutorial_completed` 0; the client draws every page (title,
body, buttons, picture) from the league struct's param 1033 tutorial struct, with enums keyed by
that varbit, so the server only moves the varbit and opens the screens. A character that joined
before the tutorial existed has no stage and counts as finished: the login sends the league's
finished value, 12 (every Raging Echoes capture's login) or Leagues VI's 14 (243 logins sent it).

- **Screens, as captured before every page:** `league_tutorial` (653) in the toplevel's
  `overlay_atmosphere` (161:1) with its click blocker 653:1 shown, `mesoverlay` (263) in
  `chatbox:crmclose` (162:565 in this cache), script 1974 with an empty line, script 2524 (-1, -1)
  and `league_tutorial_main` (677) as the main modal, closed and reopened at each stage so the
  client draws the new page. `orbs_disabled` (4084) and `chatoverlay_allowmesoverlap` (10690) are 1
  while it runs. It opens once the welcome screen's Play is clicked, or the new character's design
  closes. Not sent, though captured: `minimap_toggle` (no such packet here), `side_journal_tab` = 1
  with the quest list mounted on Get Started (this client mounts journal tabs on their click), and
  the orbs interface reopened at the end (this client keeps it).
- **Stages** (Raging Echoes; Demonic Pacts adds 11-13 and finishes at 14): 0 the welcome page, Get
  Started (677:9) sets `league_3_has_seen_cutscene` and jumps to 3; 3 flashes the journal stone
  (`flashside` 3, OP1 armed on stone2 of every gameframe layout: 161:61, 164:54, 548:66) until it is
  clicked; 4 flashes the journal's Leagues tab (script 3162 on 629:42) until the side panel (656)
  mounts, which awards "Open the Leagues Menu" (`open-the-leagues-menu`; a mount at stage 3 counts
  for both steps); 5 / 7 / 9 pulse the Tasks / Areas /
  Relics buttons (script 3185 on 656:35 / 39 / 43, 3186 stops it) and, when the section's screen
  opens, run its walkthrough (6 / 8 / 10); Raging Echoes then waits for an area unlock
  (`league:area-unlocked`) and every league for a relic pick (`league:relic-unlocked`); 11 (13 for
  Demonic Pacts) is Finishing Up, whose End Tutorial (677:8) awards "Complete the Leagues
  Tutorial" (`complete-the-leagues-tutorial`), restores the orbs and closes the screens. Both tasks
  go through the task catalog's `league:complete-task` (its points, list bit and message); with no
  catalog on the server they pay 10 points each through `league:award-task`. Exit
  Leagues (677:8 on the first page) logs the character out (ours: never pressed in a recording).
- **Other plugins' screens:** the task list (657) and the area map (512) belong to their own
  plugins. The tutorial never handles their buttons; it watches for their screen to open through
  the core's `interface:opened` (reacting once the opening plugin has finished, a microtask
  later), and a section whose screen has not opened two ticks after its button was clicked is
  skipped (on a server without the
  tasks and areas plugins, 5 goes to 7 and 7 to 9). Demonic Pacts' pacts section (stage 11, the
  tree 647) runs no walkthrough: its middle step waits for a pact point to be spent in an interface
  this server does not have, so its button goes straight to 13.
- **Always finishable:** besides the skip, a relic picked or an area unlocked before its page counts
  when that page's walkthrough ends (the relics' `league:relic-unlocked` state, the area selection
  varbit 10663); the page or a section's screen closed half way (Escape, walking away) brings the
  page back a tick later unless another screen replaced it, and the walkthrough starts again when
  the screen is reopened (a walkthrough already seen this session is not shown twice); a relog
  resumes at the page of a walkthrough stage.
- **Walkthroughs** (`plugins/interface/ScreenHighlight.plugin.js`, usable by any content): the
  cache's `screenhighlight` (664) in the screen's `tutorial_highlight` layer (657:14, 512:13,
  655:13) with OP1 on Continue (664:31) and Previous (664:32) slot 9, script 3408, the varbits
  `hnt_selected_hint` / `hnt_hint_step` / `hnt_hint_max_step`, and per step a box (3409) or a
  framed component (2463) and its text (3413 or 2465), with the arguments, texts and colour (the
  league struct's param 1027) each recording shows. The pause button live also arms (664:9) is not:
  its resume packet reaches this server as a dialogue continue. On this web client the first click
  after a step redraws can go to the component that was under the pointer before; a second click
  (or any mouse move first) reaches Continue.
- **Per league:** Raging Echoes and Demonic Pacts are as recorded. Trailblazer Reloaded and
  Trailblazer use Leagues V's tutorial struct (747), whose text this cache writes for Leagues V, so
  they get copies of its title and body enums with their own name through the content payload, and
  Raging Echoes' walkthroughs with their name. Twisted's struct has no tutorial and Shattered Relics'
  is a different flow (its class choice), so neither starts one.

## Welcome screen

`league/Welcome.LeagueMode.js`: on a league world the welcome screen's message of the week
(`welcome_screen:motw`, 378:6) reads, as captured, `Welcome to Old School RuneScape: <league>!`
and, when world.json's pluginConfig `league:end` (an ISO date) is set, `There are N days remaining
in this League.` WelcomeScreen emits `welcome-screen:shown`.

## Records

`league/Records.LeagueMode.js`: the main game's league screens, as captured on rev 229
(osrs-captures 229/00690-00702). Each opens as the main modal after script 2524 (-1, -1).

- **Points:** at a main character's login on a plain world, the account's league save is read
  through the persistence backend. LeaguePoints totals its tasks (`league:saved-points`), and the
  total goes out as that league's main-game varp (2771, 2772, 3275, 4032, 4556 or 5507, the ones
  script 9462 reads). An account keeps one league character, so the other leagues read 0.
- **Trophies (447):** the Leagues Tutor's Claim-trophies, its conversation's open_interface
  "League trophies", and `::leaguerecords trophies` open it. The setevents cover OP1 and OP10 on
  447:3, and script 1128 takes the title and five masks over enum 2778's trophies. A set bit shows
  Take, a clear one Store. The client hides a trophy above the league's points (script 1129).
- **Take and Store:** a trophy is the Tutor's to hand out while the character holds none of it in
  the inventory, equipment or bank (a bank placeholder doesn't count), so a lost one can be taken
  again (Wiki "League trophy"). Take hands out an earned one; Store takes it back from the
  inventory. Each click resends the masks through script 1130, and op10 examines. A click with
  the screen closed does nothing.
- **Accomplishment scroll (41182):** League-statistics opens 449 with script 1110 (the owner's
  name and each league's points). League-rankings opens 445 and nothing else. League-firsts opens
  676 with script 3698 on the newest league, with OP1 on one dropdown slot per league; a pick
  redraws that league. Rankings and firsts are the cache's own tables.

On a league world none of this applies: the Tutor's Claim-trophies and the scroll's options fall
through to their defaults. Bots and agent players never read a league save.

## Reward shop

`league/Rewards.LeagueMode.js`: the Leagues Reward Shop (`league_rewards`, 658), as captured on
league worlds (osrs-captures 227/00100, 02120, 237/01098).

- **Stock:** the cache's. Each league struct lists its reward structs in param 87, with the name
  (363), item (150) and cost (151). A set (the Relic Hunter outfits, six ornament kits) lists every
  item it gives in the enum param 915 names; param 2068 is how many of the item a set-less reward
  gives. The client draws every league's rewards, rows running across the leagues in order; this
  cache has 65, as rev 237 did.
- **Opening:** the Leagues Tutor's Trade (main game) and Rewards (league world) options, the
  conversations' open_shop "Leagues Reward Shop", and `::leagueshop`. It sends script 2524 (-1, -1),
  the modal, and OP1 on 658:9 over one slot per reward. The Bank PIN guards it first.
- **Buying:** a row click sets `league_rewards_shopselection` (10110) to the row. Confirm (658:22)
  sells the selected reward in the main game, if the points left cover it and the inventory has a
  slot for each piece. The points left are each league's points (Records) less what the character
  spent of them (`league:reward-points-spent`, by league type), sent as varp 2613. Confirm's click
  shows a loading layer (658:24) no script hides, so the shop closes and opens afresh a tick later.
  Closing the shop forgets the selection.
- **League worlds:** the shop opens to browse. Live sends no points there, and the client hides
  Confirm where the league struct's param 2053 says so. A Confirm that reaches the server gets the
  client's own line, "You can purchase these rewards on a Non-Leagues world."

The Wiki pools every league's points. This server knows one league per account, the one its league
character played. On this server's NPC spawns only `::leagueshop` reaches the shop: the one Leagues
Tutor spawned (315, Lumbridge) has neither Trade nor Rewards, and `npc-interactions.json` binds its
Talk-to to a custom shop, so its conversation never runs.

## Relics

`LeagueRelics.plugin.js`, data `plugins/modes/data/league-relics.json`: eight tiers a league,
each with a point cost, a passive and three relics (Wiki); a tier's pick is permanent. A
character's picks live in `league:relics` (tier index -> slot 1-3).

- **The catalog.** The cache's relic interface (655) reads the league struct's tier enum (param
  870), tier structs (877 cost, 878 relic enum, 2045 passive struct) and relic structs (879 name,
  880 description, 885 tier, 1855 has-item), but the cache only carries the current league's.
  The server sends a league's own as `structOverrides` / `enumOverrides` datasets through the
  content payload above (`GamemodeContentStore` and the cs2 `struct_param` / `enum` ops read them
  before the cache) at login and before the interface opens. Ids start at 200000 + league type
  x 1000; icons are borrowed from the cache's own relic in the same tier and slot. Demonic Pacts
  (`"6": { "fromCache": true }`) is read from the cache instead: its tiers, costs, passives and
  relics come from struct 6436's enums, the relic keys are their names slugged, and no relic
  hands out an item, since the cache does not say which do.
- **The flow, as captured.** The side panel's View Relics (656:44) opens 655 as the main modal
  with `if_setevents` on its slots (655:22, 0-23) and menu (655:6, 10-20). A slot click sets
  `league_relic_last_viewed` (10048) to tier x 3 + slot and runs the client's redraw scripts 3193
  (the panel's components, the state 2 both captured clicks sent for an affordable, unchosen
  tier (other states were not captured), the relic struct, the tier's passive struct) and 3181.
  Known issue: on this web client the relic information panel stays blank after those two
  scripts (`extra_info` 655:27 remains hidden, for data-driven and cache-native leagues alike;
  every component id was re-checked against the rev 241 gamevals and the scripts run without a
  cs2 error), so the pick is only reachable through `::relic` until the client's cs2 side is
  fixed. Confirm (655:50) unlocks the viewed relic: its tier's selection varbit
  (10049-10053, 11696, 17301, 17302) = the slot, animation 8524, the league's unlock graphic
  (struct param 1021: 2603 Trailblazer Reloaded, 3044 Raging Echoes) at height 92, the modal
  closed, sounds 4215/4211/4213/4212 at 8/44/80/104. Points crossing a tier's cost show "New
  Relic Available!" / "You've gained enough points to unlock a tier N Relic!" with jingle 281, in
  the orange the capture shows on a Raging Echoes world (the task popup, by contrast, uses the
  league's colour). Slot and confirm clicks count only after View Relics opened the interface.
- **The checks.** A league character, a real slot, no pick in that tier, the tier's points, a
  bank open when the Wiki says the relic must be unlocked in one (`requiresBank`: every
  Trailblazer Reloaded item relic; Raging Echoes' Clue Compass, Bank Heist and Fairy's Flight,
  while its tier-1 tools are handed out anywhere, as the Leagues V tutorial's Animal Wrangler
  unlock in osrs-captures 227/00196 shows; the modal replaces the bank as the main interface, so
  what was open when View Relics was clicked counts), and room for every item in the inventory
  or a bank tab, so a permanent pick is never saved without its items; each item goes to the
  inventory if it fits, else to its bank tab, else to any tab with room. Refusals are game
  messages of ours. Items no longer in this cache (Sage's greaves, the Trailblazer tools, the crystal of
  memories, the guardian horn) are not granted; the data says so.
- **Effects** are other plugins' business: they ask `league:has-relic { player, relic }`, true
  only when the character's league has that relic and chose it. The tier passives' XP rates are
  LeagueMode's (`league:highest-tier`); the other passives are not implemented.

### Trailblazer Reloaded's combat relics

Three relics have their effects (`leaguerelics/*.LeagueRelics.js`, numbers in the data's
`effects`; the Wiki's, as no recording of Trailblazer Reloaded exists):

- **Superior Sorcerer** (tier 4): magic attacks every 2 ticks (the new `onAttackSpeed` hook, asked
  after the weapon's, spell's or special's own speed), magic accuracy x2.75 and +200 permille
  magic damage (the equipment-effect modifiers), a 90% roll a cast that keeps the runes (the
  existing `magic:rune-saving`, asked once the cast has checked the player has them, so they are
  required but not spent) or the staff's charge (`combat:consume-charge`, asked by the trident in
  core and by the Sanguinesti staff and Tumeken's shadow before a charge is spent), in multicombat
  a landed spell also hits up to five attackable targets within a tile of its target for 0 to 25%
  of its damage (fixed-damage hits that pay no XP, never splash themselves and are not scaled
  again by Berserker, since the hit they derive from already was), and the standard
  binds and Ancient ice spells always land unless the target is frozen or still freeze-immune.
- **Berserker** (tier 7): every hit is multiplied by 1 + 0.004 x missing hitpoints (floored), and a
  hit on an NPC at full health is forced accurate at its max.
- **Undying Retribution** (tier 8): when a death would go ahead (`onPlayerBeforeDeath`, after any
  other content kept the player alive) and three minutes have passed since it last fired:
  hitpoints and prayer to their max, poison, venom and the poison immunity cleared, the
  Retribution prayer's graphic 437 (ours), and a reflected hit of 0 to 2 x Prayer level on every
  attackable NPC within three tiles that is not attack-immune and that the area's policy lets
  the player fight (recoil-immune ones only if Nex, the Hespori, Vorkath or a Wilderness boss)
  and 0 to half the Prayer level on each player fighting them. The cooldown is a timestamp
  attribute (0 when ready), reset by a real death (`onPlayerDefeated`, which fires only once
  the death went ahead). A plugin that already prevented
  the death on this hook is honoured; one attached after this plugin would see the relic fire
  first, since every before-death hook runs. Raid death penalties are not exempted yet.

## Developer commands

- `::league [player]` - the character's league and points.
- `::leaguetask <id> <points> [name]` - award yourself a task through the real award path (the
  task catalog, LeagueTasks, does not exist yet).
- `::relic [tier 1-8] [slot 1-3]` - list your relics, or choose one through the usual checks.
- `::leaguerecords <trophies|statistics|rankings|firsts>` - open a main-game record screen.
- `::leagueshop` - open the Leagues Reward Shop.

## Not yet

League tasks, area unlocks, combat masteries, the other tier passives (drop rates, run energy,
clue boxes, minigame points, the ironman restriction), and Shattered Relics' own panels. Each is
its own item on the progress tracker. The records have no POH league hall to stand in: its trophy
case, pedestals and scroll need the house's league hall, which this server doesn't build yet, so
the scroll's options answer only where the loc exists.

The cache's "League Skill Cape Shop" (652) is not a shop: its only script (3201) creates 22 tiny
cape items and prints "Loading: <cape>" for each, a model preloader. Nothing sells through it, and
the Wiki names no such shop.
