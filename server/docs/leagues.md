# Leagues

The Leagues game mode (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Leagues) on this server: a league
character per account, League Points, relic tiers and relics. Plugins: `plugins/modes/LeagueMode.plugin.js`
(the profile, its league, XP rate, the tiers' passives, journal tab), `LeaguePoints.plugin.js`
(points) and `LeagueRelics.plugin.js` (tiers and relics); data in `plugins/modes/data/leagues.json`,
`league-relics.json` and `league-boosted-drops.json`.

## The league character

Live OSRS runs Leagues on their own worlds, where an account plays a fresh character. Here a
world runs a league when its plugin config says so:

```json
"pluginConfig": { "league:type": 4 }
```

(4 Trailblazer Reloaded, 5 Raging Echoes; `world.local.json` can set it per deployment).
LeagueMode reads it at startup and claims the world's character profile (`api.setWorldProfile`,
`GameConstants.WORLD_PROFILE`), so every login is the account's **league character**, a save
kept apart from its main one (`persistence/PlayerProfile.ts`):

- JSON saves: `data/saves/characters/league/<name>.json` beside the main `<name>.json`.
- SQLite and IndexedDB: the key `league:<name>`, prefixed after the name is normalised, so no
  account name can collide with it.
- `Player.getProfile()` says which character is online; it is never written into the save. Both
  share the name, so only one can be online at a time, as on live, and friends see the account
  online either way.
- The account has one credential: its main character's. A league character's own hash only
  stands in while no main character exists (an account first made on a league world), and a
  main character made later takes it. So a name can't be claimed on either world with a password
  of one's own, and `::changepassword` (`PlayerPersistence.changePassword`) writes the new hash
  to both characters and signs out every remembered login on both.
- A "Stay logged in" token belongs to the character it was issued on (each save keeps its own),
  and the world decides the character, so a token from one world's character never opens the
  other's.
- Known limits: the SQLite backend's one-time import of legacy JSON saves reads only the main
  files; admin commands that address saves by name reach the main profile only; an offline
  update to either save (an external store purchase) is refused while the account's other
  character is online, since both share the name.

The world's league is the one a new league character joins; the character keeps it in
`league:type`. A new Trailblazer Reloaded character starts at Herblore 3, Runecraft 5 and
Agility 10 (Wiki). A main character never has a league, whatever its attributes say.

## Events

| Event | Payload | Who answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `journal:tab-mounted` | `{ player, groupId, tabIndex }` (SideJournalDefaults) | LeagueMode listens |
| `league:profile` | `{ player } -> { league: type \| null }` | LeagueMode |
| `league:login` | `{ player, league }` after a league profile's login | LeaguePoints, LeagueRelics listen |
| `league:highest-tier` | `{ player } -> { tier }` (0-based, -1 none) | LeagueRelics |
| `league:award-task` | `{ player, id, points, name } -> { awarded }` | LeaguePoints (once per id) |
| `league:points` | `{ player } -> { points, tasks }` | LeaguePoints |
| `league:points-changed` | `{ player, points, previous, tasks }` | LeagueMode (journal), LeagueRelics listen |
| `league:has-relic` | `{ player, relic } -> { active }` | LeagueRelics |

The tier passives answer other plugins' questions rather than events of their own (below):
`npc-drops:chance` and `drops:chance`, `minigame:points`, `slayer:task-reward`,
`slayer:superior-spawn` and `treasure-trails:scroll-boxes`.

## What the client is sent

From the rsprox Leagues V recordings (osrs-captures 227/00070 and 227/00075; the packets are the
same for every league):

- Login: varbits `league_account` 10031 = 1, `league_type` 10032, `league_tutorial_completed`
  10037 = 12, `league_total_tasks_completed` 10046; varps `league_points_completed` 2614,
  `league_points_claimed` 2615, `league_points_previous` 2807; the relic selection varbits.
- A task award: 10046 and 2614 rise, then 2615; the popup (`notification:show`) "League Task
  Complete!" / "Task Completed: <col=ffffff>Name</col><br><br>Points Earned: <col=ffffff>N</col>"
  in the league's colour with jingle 283, and script 3226 refills the side panel's bar (656:23).
- The journal's Leagues tab (side_journal 629:34) shows once the varbits are set; a click mounts
  the league side panel (656) in the journal's content container (629:43) with the tab varbit
  8168 = 4, the way this client mounts its other journal tabs (live mounted it in its own slot).
- XP: the league's rate (5x; 8x from relic tier 2, 12x from tier 5, 16x from tier 7, Wiki tier
  passives) multiplies every gain after the world's rate, through the can-gain-experience
  hook's `multiplier`; the other tier passives are under "Tier passives" below.

## Relics

`LeagueRelics.plugin.js`, data `plugins/modes/data/league-relics.json`: eight tiers a league,
each with a point cost, a passive and three relics (Wiki); a tier's pick is permanent. A
character's picks live in `league:relics` (tier index -> slot 1-3).

- **The catalog.** The cache's relic interface (655) reads the league struct's tier enum (param
  870), tier structs (877 cost, 878 relic enum, 2045 passive struct) and relic structs (879 name,
  880 description, 885 tier, 1855 has-item), but the cache only carries the current league's.
  The server sends a league's own as `structOverrides` / `enumOverrides` datasets
  (`sendContentData`; `GamemodeContentStore` and the cs2 `struct_param` / `enum` ops read them
  before the cache) at login and before the interface opens. Ids start at 200000 + league type
  x 1000; icons are borrowed from the cache's own relic in the same tier and slot.
- **The flow, as captured.** The side panel's View Relics (656:44) opens 655 as the main modal
  with `if_setevents` on its slots (655:22, 0-23) and menu (655:6, 10-20). A slot click sets
  `league_relic_last_viewed` (10048) to tier x 3 + slot and runs the client's redraw scripts 3193
  (the panel's components, the state 2 both captured clicks sent for an affordable, unchosen
  tier (other states were not captured), the relic struct, the tier's passive struct) and 3181. Confirm (655:50) unlocks the viewed relic: its tier's selection varbit
  (10049-10053, 11696, 17301, 17302) = the slot, animation 8524, the league's unlock graphic
  (struct param 1021: 2603 Trailblazer Reloaded, 3044 Raging Echoes) at height 92, the modal
  closed, sounds 4215/4211/4213/4212 at 8/44/80/104. Points crossing a tier's cost show "New
  Relic Available!" / "You've gained enough points to unlock a tier N Relic!" with jingle 281, in
  the orange the capture shows on a Raging Echoes world (the task popup, by contrast, uses the
  league's colour). Slot and confirm clicks count only after View Relics opened the interface.
- **The checks.** A league character, a real slot, no pick in that tier, the tier's points, a
  bank open when the relic hands out an item (the Wiki's reason for unlocking those in one; the
  modal replaces the bank as the main interface, so what was open when View Relics was clicked
  counts), and room for every item in the inventory or a bank tab, so a permanent pick is never
  saved without its items; each item goes to the inventory if it fits, else to its bank tab, else
  to any tab with room. Refusals are game messages of ours. Items no longer in this cache (Sage's greaves, the Trailblazer tools, the crystal of
  memories, the guardian horn) are not granted; the data says so.
- **Effects** are other plugins' business: they ask `league:has-relic { player, relic }`, true
  only when the character's league has that relic and chose it. The tier passives are
  LeagueMode's (`league:highest-tier`), below.

## Tier passives

Each tier's passive text is the Wiki's (`league-relics.json`); the effects are
`leagues.json` `passives`, per league, each from the 1-based tier its `fromTier` names (a map
picks the highest tier reached), applied by `league/Passives.LeagueMode.js` and
`league/BoostedDrops.LeagueMode.js` to a league character of that league and to nobody else.
Tier 1 counts once the character chose its first relic.

- **XP rate** (both: 5x, 8x from tier 2, 12x from tier 5, 16x from tier 7): the
  can-gain-experience hook's `multiplier`, as above.
- **Combat XP** (Raging Echoes tier 3): Attack, Strength, Defence, Ranged, Magic, Hitpoints and
  Prayer gains x2 on top of the league rate (multiplicative, as the Wiki says; Slayer is not
  listed and not included).
- **Run energy** (tier 1): the run energy drain modifier (`api.registerRunEnergyDrainModifier`)
  returns 0 for the character, so running never drains.
- **Boosted drops** (Trailblazer Reloaded 2x/3x/4x/5x from tiers 1/4/6/8; Raging Echoes 2x then
  5x from tier 4): `league-boosted-drops.json` is each league's Boosted drops page (fetched
  2026-10-26), a source per Wiki row group with the NPC names it covers and the item names it
  boosts (group rows expanded by hand; N/A rows left out; rows one page lists carry `leagues`).
  NpcDrops asks `npc-drops:chance { player, npc, npcId, source, rules }` once per roll and the
  league pushes one rule `{ pattern, multiplier }` matching that source's items, which NpcDrops
  applies to every form of roll ([docs/npc-drops.md](../../docs/npc-drops.md)): a weighted roll's
  boosted weight grows and the pool with it, so 1/512 at 5x is 5/516 (the Wiki rounds to 1/102).
  Superior Slayer monsters' unique tables and Treasure Trails caskets' "clue uniques" rows ask the
  same over `drops:chance { player, source: "superior-slayer-monster" | "treasure-trails-casket",
  rules }`, the pages' Global entries (a tier's "clue uniques" and mega-rare rows; an ordinary
  casket's Open and the Mimic's reward share `Rolls.uniqueMultiplier`). Kills whose
  table NpcDrops rolls are covered as they are, Araxxor's and Zalcano's included (their plugins
  roll through NpcDrops with the NPC named); the giant lairs' chests pass `source` (Obor,
  Bryophyta). Sources rolled by their own plugins are in the data but inert until that plugin
  asks `drops:chance` with the source's name: Revenants, the Grotesque Guardians, Corporeal
  Beast's sigils (not on its table here), the raids' unique chests, Barrows, the Gauntlet,
  Wintertodt, Tempoross, Guardians of the Rift, Fishing Trawler, the Grand Hallowed Coffin, Moons
  of Peril, the Colosseum, Hunter rumours, the Shrine, the seed pack, aerial fishing, the
  Fountain of Rune, Larran's and the brimstone chest, the Zombie Pirate's Locker, chewed bones,
  the Volcanic Mine ore pack, Pyramid Plunder, Tai Bwo Wannai, Shades of Mort'ton, and the
  pickpocketed blood shards (vyres) and teleport seeds (elves).
- **Minigame points** (Trailblazer Reloaded 3x/5x/8x from tiers 2/5/7; Raging Echoes 4x/8x from
  tiers 1/4): a minigame asks `minigame:points { player, minigame, points }` as it awards and
  the league multiplies `points` (floored). Wired, from the Raging Echoes League page's "Boosted
  minigame points" section (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Raging_Echoes_League; the
  Trailblazer Reloaded pages give no list, so both leagues use it): Pest Control
  commendations, Soul Wars zeal, Castle Wars tickets, Guardians of the Rift points, Mage Training
  Arena pizazz points, Volcanic Mine points, Giants' Foundry reputation, Mastering Mixology resin,
  Mahogany Homes points, Tithe Farm points, Brimhaven Agility Arena tickets and vouchers,
  Warriors' Guild tokens, Hallowed marks, marks of grace, stardust. Not on this server: Barbarian
  Assault, Rogues' Den, Trouble Brewing, Tai Bwo Wannai favour, Motherlode nuggets, molch
  pearls, Mining Guild minerals, chompy kills.
- **Slayer** (Trailblazer Reloaded tier 4, Raging Echoes tier 3): the Slayer plugin asks
  `slayer:task-reward { player, master, freeTasks, multiplier }` as a task completes (the league
  sets `freeTasks` 0 and x5 the points; every master's, Mortimer's and Krystilia's included, the
  Wiki naming none) and `slayer:superior-spawn { player, npc, unlocked, chance }` on a task kill
  (the league unlocks Bigger and Badder and makes the chance 1 in 50; the Slayer rewards'
  toggle-off still holds; a better chance from elsewhere stands).
- **Scroll boxes** (tier 1): ClueCapacity asks `treasure-trails:scroll-boxes { player, unlocked,
  capacity }` and the league answers unlocked with no limit, so every clue drops as a stackable
  box (the Wiki says stackable; live Leagues had no cap) before X Marks the Spot.

Left out, with why: Raging Echoes' clue-step progress saved between clues (the trail runtime has
no per-step save to carry across scrolls); Raging Echoes' one-minute farming ticks (Farming's
growth model has no tick-length seam, and Farming is under active work elsewhere); the
Trailblazer Reloaded ironman restriction and the crystal of memories (not in this cache).

### Trailblazer Reloaded's combat relics

Three relics have their effects (`leaguerelics/*.LeagueRelics.js`, numbers in the data's
`effects`; the Wiki's, as no recording of Trailblazer Reloaded exists):

- **Superior Sorcerer** (tier 4): magic attacks every 2 ticks (the new `onAttackSpeed` hook, asked
  after the weapon's, spell's or special's own speed), magic accuracy x2.75 and +200 permille
  magic damage (the equipment-effect modifiers), a 90% roll a cast that keeps the runes (the
  existing `magic:rune-saving`, asked once the cast has checked the player has them, so they are
  required but not spent) or the staff's charge (`combat:consume-charge`, asked by the trident in
  core and by the Sanguinesti staff and Tumeken's shadow before a charge is spent), in multicombat
  a landed spell also hits up to five attackable targets within a tile of its target for 0 to 25%
  of its damage (fixed-damage hits that pay no XP, never splash themselves and are not scaled
  again by Berserker, since the hit they derive from already was), and the standard
  binds and Ancient ice spells always land unless the target is frozen or still freeze-immune.
- **Berserker** (tier 7): every hit is multiplied by 1 + 0.004 x missing hitpoints (floored), and a
  hit on an NPC at full health is forced accurate at its max.
- **Undying Retribution** (tier 8): when a death would go ahead (`onPlayerBeforeDeath`, after any
  other content kept the player alive) and three minutes have passed since it last fired:
  hitpoints and prayer to their max, poison, venom and the poison immunity cleared, the
  Retribution prayer's graphic 437 (ours), and a reflected hit of 0 to 2 x Prayer level on every
  attackable NPC within three tiles that is not attack-immune and that the area's policy lets
  the player fight (recoil-immune ones only if Nex, the Hespori, Vorkath or a Wilderness boss)
  and 0 to half the Prayer level on each player fighting them. The cooldown is a timestamp
  attribute (0 when ready), reset by a real death (`onPlayerDefeated`, which fires only once
  the death went ahead). A plugin that already prevented
  the death on this hook is honoured; one attached after this plugin would see the relic fire
  first, since every before-death hook runs. Raid death penalties are not exempted yet.

## Developer commands

- `::league [player]` - the character's league and points.
- `::leaguetask <id> <points> [name]` - award yourself a task through the real award path (the
  task catalog, LeagueTasks, does not exist yet).
- `::relic [tier 1-8] [slot 1-3]` - list your relics, or choose one through the usual checks.

## Not yet

League tasks, area unlocks, combat masteries, the tier passives left out above (clue-step
progress, farming ticks, the ironman restriction), the boosted sources their own plugins have yet
to ask about, the league tutorial, trophies and rewards. Each is its own item on the progress
tracker.
